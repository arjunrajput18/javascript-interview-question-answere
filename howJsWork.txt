Here is the notes guys hope it will hep you to save your time-

*How JavaScript works?
Ans-Everything in JavaScript happens inside an "execution context".

Execution context has two component
1)memory component[variable environment] 
-This is the place where all variables and functions are stored as key value pairs. eg-{key: value ||  n:2;} 

 2)code component[Thread of execution]
-This is the place where code is executed one line at a time

Note-
*JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language

-Single threaded means JavaScript can execute once command at a time
-Synchronous single-threaded that means JavaScript can execute one command at a time in a specific order.


JavaScript is Synchronous single-threaded language.
That whole thing is called as execution context inside that there two things 
1.Memory component
2.Code component
In memory component variable and functions values can be stored in a  key value format.
Code component is a place where whole JavaScript code is executed
Memory component is also called as variable environment 
And code component is also called as thread of execution.
